- 👋 Hi, I’m @georgeharris96. I am a data scientist currently working as a research scientist at Anmut Consulting. Before that, I was a junior data scientist at Qualco UK where I began building the foundation of good data practises.
- 👀 I'm interested in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (who isn't atm), and scientific computing. In the future, I am looking for more opportunities to start learning more/using high-performance computing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TensorFlow, Weights and Biases, software design patterns and Natural Language processing! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with ML, or any other cool data projects! 
- 📫 You can reach me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-harris-256a1b128/). Feel free to drop me a line if you want to collab on a project, networking or for opportunities.
